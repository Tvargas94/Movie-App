# React Movie Search App

This month I will be creating a movie search app using the React library learned last month. This project will be created in a span of 4 weeks. From creating a project proposal and creating wireframes to showcasing the project as fully functional and ready to be deployed by the end of the month.

## Scope Of Work

This project will be created using React to fetch data to display from the Movie DB API. All the data being fetched will be styled within a card that will display the movie picture, rating, and movie description. Users will also have a search bar to search for movies they like.
